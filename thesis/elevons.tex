Elevon forces are modeled similarly to lift, as well, but with an extra term, $\delta_i$, for the deflection degree in radians:
\begin{equation}
    F_i = C_{L_\delta} \sum_{j \in [a, a_w]}  Q_{j,i} S_j \delta_i
\end{equation}
and similairly the drag created by the elevons:
\begin{equation}
    D_{\alpha_i} = C_{D_\delta} \sum_{j \in [a, a_w]}  Q_{j,i} S_j \delta_i
\end{equation}
The elevon lift, and drag, coefficient is assumed to be static over all angle of attacks since they will be in the wake of the wing, and the lift and drag are linear in the region of angles the ailerons can deflect.
