Elevon forces are modeled similarly to Lift but with an extra term, $\delta_i$, for the elevon deflection in radians:\cite{nelson}
\begin{equation}
    F_i = C_{L_\delta} \sum_{j \in [a, a_w]}  Q_{j,i} S_j \delta_i
\end{equation}
and similairly the drag created by the elevons:
\begin{equation}
    D_{\alpha_i} = C_{D_\delta} \sum_{j \in [a, a_w]}  Q_{j,i} S_j \delta_i .
\end{equation}
The elevon Lift, and Drag, coefficients are assumed to be static over all angle of attacks since they will be in the wake of the wing and thus in the linear region of angle of attack.
