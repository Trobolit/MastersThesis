Due to the change in forward velocity a change in lift is also produced, inducing a rolling moment obtained similarily:

\begin{equation}
	M_x = \int_{-b/2}^{b/2} y \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho \sqrt{v_{x,l}^2 + v_z^2} \left( C_L v_{x,l} + C_D v_{z} \right) \right) c(y) dy
\end{equation}
where $v_{x,l} = v_x - \omega_z y$.

%For the controller some linear approximation has to be found, similarly as to restoring moment due to roll rate.
