This thesis will attempt to solve the problem of mathematically modeling a flying fixed wing, develop a VTOL capable model based controller that can handle both hovering, transitioning into flying and flying, and finally implement the controller on the Pixhawk controller onboard the aircraft.
Altering the aerodynamics of the EcoSoar is out of the scope for this thesis as is embedding the controller into fully fledged flight control system for example QGroundControl.
The project takes place in Malawi with very limited supply of electronics, spare parts, electricity, tools and lab equipment.
