\section*{\textit{Acknowledgements}}

Thank \textbf{Khalid}, (George), Mr. K, Avory, Wife, etc.

[Lets see if they require rent before adding below]\\
I also want to extend a very warm thank you to Montford Special Needs College in Malawi for allowing me to stay there together with my wife during this thesis.
The staff also provided all the support needed to become integrated with the local culture and helping out with practical issues such as getting a car, finding the hospital and providing a safe circle of friends.

\section{Needed math}
To develop this controller some basic concepts are required.
\subsection{General State Space background}
Many systems can be written as a set of differential equation.

Physical systems may sometimes be mathematically modeled by state space representation, given that it can be written on the same form as equation \ref{eq:generalstatespace} .
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\bar{x}} = f(\bar{x}) + g(\bar{u},\bar{x})
    \label{eq:generalstatespace}
\end{equation}
The states, $\bar{x}$ are related by a set of first order differential equations and some input.

Systems can have one input and one state, called Single Input Single Output (SISO), or have either multiple input and outputs or both; Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems.
A system with several states, i.e. $\bar{x}$ being a vector, and several inputs, i.e. $\bar{u}$ being a vector is thus represented by a set of functions $\bar{f}$ and $\bar{g}$.

Diff. Eqs, state feedback, observability, controllability.
Are obs and contr. applicable on non linear systems?

\section{Numerical approximations for Coefficients}
Since the functions describing the coefficient of lift and drag are empirically obtained analytical expressions are helpful to obtain.
Below are two approximations that closely follow the characteristics of the coefficients in the graphs above.
The functions will have to be adapted for the EcoSoar.

\begin{equation}
C_D(\alpha) = 0.2663 \alpha^4 -1.676 \alpha^3 + 2.555 \alpha^2 + 0.2559 \alpha + 0.2% ; % 0.2 was 0 before camber guess
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is in radians in the interval $[0,\pi]$.

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
    C_D(\alpha) &= 2.939 10^{-6} \alpha^3 -0.0009205 \alpha^2 + 0.05943 \alpha -0.00613 \\
    +&
    0.85 e^{ -0.1 (\alpha - 10)^2 - 1 } + 0.4 e^{ -0.1 (\alpha - 5)^2 + -1 } - 0.15 e^{ -0.01 (\alpha - 20)^2 + -1 }
    + 0.3
\end{split}\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is in degrees in the interval $[0,90]$.
To get the full range mirror and flip it across $\alpha = 90 \degree$.
You will need to adjust the $0.3$ offset accordingly as well since it is added due to camber.
